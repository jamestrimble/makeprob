# Make probs

For a kidney-exchange `.input` file, create a `.prob` file with uniform failure
probabilities.

The `.input` file is read from standard input, and the resulting `.prob` file
is written to standard output. The program takes two positional command-line
arguments: the vertex failure probability and the edge failure probability.
